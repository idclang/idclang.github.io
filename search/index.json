[{"content":"Author: IDCL Editor\nWelcome to the Initiative on Dravidian Culture \u0026amp; Languages.\nInitiative on Dravidian Culture and Languages (IDCL) aims to preserve and promote the linguistic and cultural diversity on India and beyond. The project has been established to improve the availability of resources and dedicate digital platforms for the enrichment of languages and cultures.\nThe importance of language preservation has become a necessity in this age of globalisation. More than 3000 languages in the world are considered as endangered. This means that about half of the world\u0026rsquo;s linguistic identity is currently under threat. Linguistically diverse countries like India are struggling to conserve their indigenous languages. Languages spoken by the majority are pushing minority languages into extinction, and the lack of effective government programmes are pushing these underprivileged communities into an identity crisis.\nIn recent years, many interested individuals have come forward to take effective actions to protect their linguistic and cultural identity. Various digital platforms became a boon for these volunteers. However, due to a lack of resources and affordable tools, it has been very difficult for the to work in such projects.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s see what we can do to preserve and promote these languages.\n1. Resource gathering Documentation can be in text, image, video or audio format. Recording the speech of native speakers is an effective way to document under-resourced languages. The documentation in image format can be converted to text for further analysis. If possible, gathering resources from archives and converting them to various digital formats becomes very helpful for language development.\n2. Preparing Educational materials Educational materials can be prepared in two ways ;\n  full documentation, which includes grammar, vocabulary, orthography etc.\n  preparing educational materials for beginners or translating books (sciences, social studies etc.) from other languages to the target language.\n  Developing digital tools such as software, translators and learning apps. While this process requires a lot of resources and work, the end-user receives a lot of benefits. The accessibility and affordability of such tools make the conservation of the target language much easier.\n  Volunteering Individual projects This require the collection of data, conversion of data into usable formats, preparation of digital materials and publishing them.\nGroup projects A group of volunteers contributing to a project. This method reduces the workload, increases the overall performance, reduces the time taken to publish the final material.\n For enquiries, reach out to us through dclprogramme@gmail.com\nFollow us on\nInstagram | Youtube | Facebook\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://idclang.github.io/p/info/thumbnail_huc1b1eca10b8f830a09f561d8f30ddc72_620997_120x120_fill_box_smart1_2.png","permalink":"https://idclang.github.io/p/info/","title":"IDCL"}]

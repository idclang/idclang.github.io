[{"content":"Beary Language Author: IDCL editor Languages:\nBeary (Byari), ಬ್ಯಾರಿ, ബ്യാരി or nakk-nikk, is a Dravidian language spoken chiefly in Southern Karnataka and Northern Kerala. It belongs to the stock of Malayalam languages, and Beary displays similarities with the Malayalam language. It is spread across the Mangaluru-Udupi coast and Manjeshwaram in the Kasargod district of Kerala. This sublime language has a continuum of 1200 years. Environed by diverse ethno-lingual communities, the language underwent many phonological and grammatical modifications. Due to the continuous liaison with Tulu, Beary\u0026rsquo;s phonology can be associated with the Tulu language.\nBeary Language\nThere are several constructs associated with the etymology of the name Beary. One popular theory suggests that the word Beary arrives from the Tulu word, which signifies trade. This might be true to some extent because a major portion of the Beary speaking community carry out business activities.\nCurrently, an estimated number of 1.5 million people speak Beary as their mother tongue. The majority of Beary speakers belong to the Muslim community, and their heritage and culture dates back to thousands of years. They are one of the oldest Muslim communities in India who are part of the Dravidian heritage.\nThe Beary language developed from an early dialect of spoken Malayalam, and amalgamated with dialects of Tulu. Due to religious and historical trade connexion with Arabia, the Beary language habituates a considerable amount of Arabic loan words. The language also has a moderate degree of comprehensibility with Malayalam language.\nPhonology Vowels     Close Mid Open     Short Front i e ɛ (æ)   Short Central ɨ̆ (ŭ)  a   Short Back u o    Long Front iː (ī) eː (ē)    Long Central   aː (ā)   Long Back uː (ū) oː (ō)     Diphthongs Diphthongs include ai and au.\nConsonants (original)     Labial Dental Alveolar Retroflex Postalveolar | Palatal Velar Glottal     Nasal m n n (ṉ) ṇ ɲ (ñ) ŋ (ṅ)    Stop / Affricate plain p | b t̪ (t) | d̪ (d) t (ṯ) | d (ḏ) ʈ (ṭ) | ɖ (ḍ) t͡ɕ~t͡ʃ (c) | d͡ʑ~d͡ʒ (j) k | g    Fricative f  s  ɕ~ʃ (ś)  h   Approx. central ʋ (v)    j (y)     Approx. lateral   l       Tap   ɾ (r)       Trill   r (ṟ)        Consonants (extended)     Labial Dental Alveolar Retroflex Postalveolar | Palatal Velar Glottal     Nasal m n n (ṉ) ṇ ɲ (ñ) ŋ (ṅ)    Stop / Affricate plain p | b t̪ (t) | d̪ (d) t (ṯ) | d (ḏ) ʈ (ṭ) | ɖ (ḍ) t͡ɕ~t͡ʃ (c) | d͡ʑ~d͡ʒ (j) k | g    Stop / Affricate aspirated pʰ (ph) | bʱ (bh) t̪ʰ (th) | d̪ʱ (dh)  ʈʰ (ṭh) | ɖʱ (ḍh) t͡ɕʰ~t͡ʃʰ (ch) | d͡ʑʱ~d͡ʒʱ (jh) kʰ (kh) | ɡʱ (gh)    Fricative f  s  ɕ~ʃ (ś)  h   Approx. central ʋ (v)    j (y)     Approx. lateral   l ɭ (ḷ)      Tap   ɾ (r)       Trill   r (ṟ)        Orthography Some sources conclude that Byari once used the historical Vatteluttu script. At present, the language utilizes Kannada writing system. Recently, a new independent script arrived for writing Byari.\nComparative analysis Phonology Although being closely related to the Malayalam language, Beary phonology underwent heavy alterations because of Beary speaker\u0026rsquo;s continuous interaction with the neighbouring Tulu speaking population. Besides, Tulu influence can be observed in the morphological and syntactic structure of this language.\nOne important phonological characteristic that makes Beary distinct from Malayalam is the absence of retroflex ḻ and ṇ in its original phonology. The retroflex ḻ and ṇ becomes approximant lateral alveolar l and nasal alveolar n respectively. Like in Tulu, the retroflex ṟ is conflated with r and tt.\nAnother phonological comparison between Beary and Standard Malayalam is v to b shift, which is also prevalent in many spoken varieties of Malayalam in Northern Kerala. In Beary, the final m and n sounds of Standard Malayalam is absent. The final \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo; of standard Malayalam corresponds to the final ‘e’ in Beary, which sometimes changes to an \u0026lsquo;ae\u0026rsquo; sound.\nGrammar and Syntax Grammatical cases Noun : manuṣan (human) മനുഷ്യന്‍ | ಮನಿಸ\n    Beary Malayalam     Nominative manisa (ಮನಿಸ) manuṣyan (മനുഷ്യന്‍)   Accusative manisaro/manisare (ಮನುಸಱೊ/ಮನುಸಱೆ) manuṣyane (മനുഷ്യനെ)   Dative manisagŭ (ಮನಿಸಗ್) manuṣyanu (മനുഷ്യനു)   Instrumental manisalnīta (ಮನಿಸಲ್ನೀತ) manuṣyanāl (മനുഷ്യനാല്‍)   Comitative manisaroṭṭugu (ಮನಿಸಱೊಟ್ಟುಗು) manuṣyanōṭu (മനുഷ്യനോട്)   Genitive manisaro/manisare (ಮನುಸಱೊ/ಮನುಸಱೆ) manuṣyante (മനുഷ്യന്റെ)   Locative manisarail (ಮನಿಸಱೈಲ್) manuṣyanil (മനുഷ്യനില്‍)    Pronouns     Beary Malayalam     1sg nānŭ ñān   2sg ni nī   3sg m. avnu avan   3sg f. avlu avaḷ   3sg n. atŭ atŭ   1pl incl. naṅa nām, nammaḷ   1pl excl. naṅa ñaṅṅaḷ   3pl (higher beings) aṅa avaṟ   3pl n. atŭ ava    Numbers    English Beary Malayalam     one onnŭ (ಒನ್ನ್) onnŭ (ഒന്ന്)   two janḍhŭ (ಜನಡ್) raṇṭŭ (രണ്ട്)   three mūnnŭ (ಮೂನ್ನ್) mūnnŭ (മൂന്ന്)   four nālŭ (ನಾಲ್) nālŭ (നാല്)   five anji (ಅಂಜಿ) añcŭ (അഞ്ച്)   six ārŭ (ಆರ್) āṟŭ (ആറ്)   seven ēlŭ (ಏಲ್) ēḻŭ (ഏഴ്)   eight ettŭ (ಎತ್ತ್) eṭṭŭ (എട്ട്)   nine olinbo (ಒಲಿಂಬೊ) onpatŭ (ഒമ്പത്)   ten pattŭ (ಪತ್ತ್) pattŭ (പത്ത്)   hundred nūrŭ (ನೂರ್) nūṟŭ (നൂറ്)    Basic Vocabulary    English Beary Malayalam     Father abba, bāpa appan, accan, vāppa, bāppa   Mother umma amma, umma   Elder brother mūtonu aṇṇan, cēṭṭan, mūttāṅṅaḷa   Younger brother elāvnu aniyan, iḷayāṅṅaḷa   Elder sister mūtolu cēcci, akka, mūtta peṅṅaḷ   Younger sister elāvlu aniyatti, iḷaya peṅṅaḷ   Son mōnu makan, mōn (colloquial)   Daughter mōlu makaḷ, mōḷ (colloquial)   Head tala tala   Eye kannŭ kaṇṇŭ   Hand kai kai   Heart aduppu hr̥iṭayam, uḷḷam   Tongue nāvŭ nākkŭ, nāvŭ    Syntax The boys caught four big fishes.\nBeary: ānmakka nālŭ beliyo mīn piṭiccāṟŭ [sub+pl+number+adjective+object+verb]\nಆನ್ಮಕ್ಕ ನಾಲ್ ಬೆಲಿಯೊ ಮೀನ್ ಪಿಟಿಚ್ಚಾಱ್.\nMalayalam: āṇkuṭṭikaḷ nālu valiya mīn piṭiccu [sub+pl+number+adjective+object+verb]\nആണ്കുട്ടികൾ നാലു വലിയ മീൻ പിടിച്ചു.\nBeary follows the same syntax order as that of Malayalam language.\nArt and Literature The Beary language is rich in literature, with its poetry and folk songs having a significant place in the culture of the Beary community.\nSeveral magazines and books were published in the language.

Several literary summits were conducted to connect the literary community and to spread the use of Beary language and its literature.\nThe first Beary-language feature film Byari shared the award for the best feature film at the 59th Indian National Film Awards.\nFurther Reading and References  This documentation was possible with the help of Bearylipi Wikipedia, Beary Language  You can contribute resources for Gondi language by contacting us\n For enquiries, reach out to us through dclprogramme@gmail.com\nFollow us on\nInstagram | Youtube | Facebook\n","date":"2021-06-27T11:23:05+05:30","image":"https://idclang.github.io/p/beary-language/thumbnail_hu9e4c577ca064466a824bc6681b34d7c8_40611_120x120_fill_box_smart1_2.png","permalink":"https://idclang.github.io/p/beary-language/","title":"Beary language"},{"content":"Gunjala Gondi Author: IDCL editor languages: Telugu Tamil Malayalam and Kannada.\nGondi is a Dravidian language spoken in the Indian states of Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh. It belongs to the South Central Dravidian branch of the Dravidian language family and classified as an endangered language. It has over 2.98 million autochthonous speakers, but the language, and it\u0026rsquo;s dialects, are diminishing. Gondi is a dialect-centric language, sometimes they are pertained as Gondi languages. The primal dialects of this language include Dorla, Koya, Madiya, Muria, and Raj Gond.\nWriting system Several scripts are utilised to write Gondi language. These are associated with the dialect of Gondi. A wide view about Gondi being a strictly oral language overturned when the Gunjala Gondi orthography re-emerged with the aid of researchers from the University of Hyderabad. In addition to this, Munshi Mangal Singh Masaram excogitated a script for Gondi in 1928. Besides, the language also wonts Telugu and Devanagri orthographies.\nAll scripts of Gondi have UNICODE encoding.\nGunjala Gondi Script Your device may not be able to render this script, for that you can see the images provided under\nVowels    𑵶𑶍𑶕𑶀𑵵𑶊 𑵶𑶓𑶕𑶂𑶋 ISO 15919 [ తెలుగు ] 𑵶𑶍𑶕𑶀𑵵𑶊 𑵶𑶓𑶕𑶂𑶋 ISO 15919 [ తెలుగు ]     𑵠 a [అ] 𑵧 e [ఎ]   𑵡 ā [ఆ] 𑵨 ai [ఐ]   𑵢 i [ఇ] 𑵪 ō [ఓ]   𑵣 ī [ఈ] 𑵫 au [ఔ]   𑵤 u [ఉ]     𑵥 ū [ఊ]      Consonants    𑵶𑶍𑶕𑶀𑵵𑶊 𑵶𑶓𑶕𑶂𑶋 ISO 15919 [ తెలుగు ] 𑵶𑶍𑶕𑶀𑵵𑶊 𑵶𑶓𑶕𑶂𑶋 ISO 15919 [ తెలుగు ]     𑵬 y [య] 𑵹 dh [ధ]   𑵭 v [వ] 𑵺 n [న]   𑵮 b [బ] 𑵻 c [చ]   𑵯 bh [భ] 𑵼 ch [ఛ]   𑵰 m [మ] 𑵽 ṭ [ట]   𑵱 k [క] 𑵾 ṭh [ఠ]   𑵲 kh [ఖ] 𑵿 ḷ [ళ]   𑵳 t [త] 𑶀 j [జ]   𑵴 th [థ] 𑶁 jh [ఝ]   𑵵 l [ల] 𑶂 ḍ [డ]   𑵶 g [గ] 𑶃 ḍh [ఢ]   𑵷 gh [ఘ] 𑶄 ṇ [ణ]   𑵸 d [ద] 𑶅 p [ప]     𑶆 ph [ఫ]     𑶇 h [హ]     𑶈 r [ర]     𑶉 s [స]    Images  Gondi Vowels \n Gondi Consonants \n Gondi Consonants and Numerals \n Gondi Vowel Markers \nLinks  Masaram Gondi Script Gunjala Gondi Unicode Font Download  You can contribute resources for Gondi language by contacting us\n For enquiries, reach out to us through dclprogramme@gmail.com\nFollow us on\nInstagram | Youtube | Facebook\n","date":"2021-06-27T11:23:05+05:30","image":"https://idclang.github.io/p/gondi-language/thumbnail_hu9e4c577ca064466a824bc6681b34d7c8_40611_120x120_fill_box_smart1_2.png","permalink":"https://idclang.github.io/p/gondi-language/","title":"Gunjala Gondi"},{"content":"Suriyani Malayalam Author: IDCL Editor\nLanguages: Malayalam .\nSuriyani Malayalam is a liturgical variant of the Malayalam language written with a modified version of the East Syriac script.

Languages.\nInitiative on Dravidian Culture and Languages (IDCL) aims to preserve and promote the linguistic and cultural diversity on India and beyond. The project has been established to improve the availability of resources and dedicate digital platforms for the enrichment of languages and cultures.\nThe importance of language preservation has become a necessity in this age of globalisation. More than 3000 languages in the world are considered as endangered. This means that about half of the world\u0026rsquo;s linguistic identity is currently under threat. Linguistically diverse countries like India are struggling to conserve their indigenous languages. Languages spoken by the majority are pushing minority languages into extinction, and the lack of effective government programmes are pushing these underprivileged communities into an identity crisis.\nIn recent years, many interested individuals have come forward to take effective actions to protect their linguistic and cultural identity. Various digital platforms became a boon for these volunteers. However, due to a lack of resources and affordable tools, it has been very difficult for the to work in such projects.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s see what we can do to preserve and promote these languages.\n1. Resource gathering Documentation can be in text, image, video or audio format. Recording the speech of native speakers is an effective way to document under-resourced languages. The documentation in image format can be converted to text for further analysis. If possible, gathering resources from archives and converting them to various digital formats becomes very helpful for language development.\n2. Preparing Educational materials Educational materials can be prepared in two ways ;\n  full documentation, which includes grammar, vocabulary, orthography etc.\n  preparing educational materials for beginners or translating books (sciences, social studies etc.) from other languages to the target language.\n  Developing digital tools such as software, translators and learning apps. While this process requires a lot of resources and work, the end-user receives a lot of benefits.
